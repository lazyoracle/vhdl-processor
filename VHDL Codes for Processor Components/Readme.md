This folder contains all the VHDL files necessary for simulation and synthesis of the processor. Individual components include testbenches that can be used to check their functionality.

For the top level entity when simulating the complete processor, choose either the temperature control or the chronometer program. 

The codes included here are for the structural design approach with a behavioural description for Register Bank.
